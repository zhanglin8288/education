"""
Default settings for the ``news`` app. Each of these can be
overridden in your project's settings module, just like regular
Django settings. The ``editable`` argument for each controls whether
the setting is editable via Django's admin.

Thought should be given to how a setting is actually used before
making it editable, as it may be inappropriate - for example settings
that are only read during startup shouldn't be editable, since changing
them would require an application reload.
